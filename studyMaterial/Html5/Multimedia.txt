************** Multimedia
Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.
What is Multimedia?
Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see.
Examples: Images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.
Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.
In this chapter you will learn about the different multimedia formats.

************* Multimedia Formats
Video : Only MP4, WebM, and Ogg video are supported by the HTML5 standard.
Audio: Only MP3, WAV, and Ogg audio are supported by the HTML5 standard.

********* Playing Videos in HTML
Before HTML5, a video could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).
The HTML5 <video> element specifies a standard way to embed a video in a web page.
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
************ How it Works
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.
The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.

************* HTML <video> Autoplay
To start a video automatically use the autoplay attribute:
<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
Note: The autoplay attribute does not work in mobile devices like iPad and iPhone.

************** HTML5 Video Tags
Tag	Description
<video>	Defines a video or movie
<source>	Defines multiple media resources for media elements, such as <video> and <audio>
<track>	Defines text tracks in media players

************* Audio on the Web
Before HTML5, audio files could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).
The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.
<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

************* HTML Audio - How It Works
The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.
The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

************ HTML Audio - Methods, Properties, and Events
HTML5 defines DOM methods, properties, and events for the <audio> element

This allows you to load, play, and pause audios, as well as set duration and volume.
There are also DOM events that can notify you when an audio begins to play, is paused, etc.
For a full DOM reference, go to our HTML5 Audio/Video DOM Reference.

*********** Plugins
The purpose of a plug-in is to extend the functionality of a web browser.

HTML Helpers (Plug-ins)
Helper applications (plug-ins) are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of a web browser.
Examples of well-known plug-ins are Java applets.
Plug-ins can be added to web pages with the <object> tag or the <embed> tag. 
Plug-ins can be used for many purposes: display maps, scan for viruses, verify your bank id, etc.
To display video and audio: Use the <video> and <audio> tags.

The <object> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:
Example
<object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>

The <embed> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:
Example
<embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html">

************** HTML YouTube Videos
The easiest way to play videos in HTML, is to use YouTube.
Struggling with Video Formats?
Earlier in this tutorial, you have seen that you might have to convert your videos to different formats to make them play in all browsers.
Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.
An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page.

YouTube Video Id
YouTube will display an id (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video.

You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.

Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
To play your video on a web page, do the following:

Upload the video to YouTube
Take a note of the video id
Define an <iframe> element in your web page
Let the src attribute point to the video URL
Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)

Example - Using iFrame (recommended)
<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY">
</iframe>

YouTube Autoplay
You can have your video start playing automatically when a user visits that page by adding a simple parameter to your YouTube URL.
Note: Take careful consideration when deciding to autoplay your videos. Automatically starting a video can annoy your visitor and end up causing more harm than good.
Value 0 (default): The video will not play automatically when the player loads.
Value 1: The video will play automatically when the player loads.
YouTube - Autoplay
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?autoplay=1">
</iframe>

********** YouTube Loop
Value 0 (default): The video will play only once.

Value 1: The video will loop (forever).

*********** YouTube - Loop
<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?playlist=tgbNymZ7vqY&loop=1">
</iframe>

NOTE : YouTube - Using <object> or <embed>
Note: YouTube <object> and <embed> were deprecated from January 2015. You should migrate your videos to use <iframe> instead.
