=> What is the difference between mean stack and full stack?
MEAN Stack Developer: 
Become a MEAN Stack Developer. MEAN is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies — MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js — used to develop web applications. From the client and server sides to databases, MEAN is a full-stack development toolkit.
In simple words MEAN stack developers are like JS based application developers

=>full stack developer:
Others are of the opinion that a full-stack developer is simply someone who is familiar with all layers in computer software development. These developers aren't experts at everything; they simply have a functional knowledge and ability to take a concept and turn it into a finished product.
A Full stack developer has complete knowledge in server, web appication, apis, User interface etc. They have complete idea about the idea about the whole web development process

A full stack developer is a person who is able to develop websites and web applications on the front end, and work with servers and databases on the back-end.

=> What's the difference between a web site and a web application.
website is defined by its content, while a web application is defined by its interaction with the user.

Websites are primarily informational. In this sense, http://cnn.com and http://php.net are websites, not web applications.
Web applications primarily allow the user to perform actions. Google Analytics, gmail, and jslint are web applications.
A website might just be static content - a web application would have dynamic content. It is a very fuzzy line.

=> ECMA means European Computer Manufacturer’s Association

********* What are the differences between Grunt, Gulp.js and Bower? Why & when to use them? *************
The Gulp one-liner from their website:
Automate and enhance your workflow

The Grunt one-liner from theirs:
The JavaScript Task Runner

And Bower:
A package manager for the web

=> Grunt focuses on configuration, while Gulp focuses on code
=> The first significant difference is that Gulp has been designed to use a series of plugins that each do a task.
=> Grunt uses plugins that often accomplish multiple tasks at the same time. 

********* Spec file  **************
The spec files are unit tests for your source files, 
Spec files are generated when you use angular-cli they contain your unit tests for the generated componet or service. 

************** Primtive-- Non-privmtive ************
A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. In JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015).All of these are inmutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed, while Objects, Array, Date, and others are mutable.

Non-primitive data types are not defined by the programming language, but are instead created by the programmer. They are sometimes called "reference variables," or "object references," since they reference a memory location, which stores the data.
Non Primitive Data Types:
Object
Array
RegExp


**** Hoisting  ***************
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
function abc(){    
a = 10;
b = 20;
let aa = a*b;
var a, b;
console.log(aa);
}
abc();

JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

Note = >
JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted
JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
function abc(){    
var a = 10;
let aa = a*b;
var b = 100;
console.log(aa);
}
abc();    O/P: NaN error
