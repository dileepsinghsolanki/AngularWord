*********** Functions as Values ********** 
Because JavaScript has first-class functions
=> you can use them just as you do any other objects. 
You can assign them to variables, add them
to objects, pass them to other functions as arguments, and return them
from functions. Basically, you can use a function anywhere you would
use any other reference value. 

function sayHi() {
 console.log("Hi!");
}
sayHi(); // outputs "Hi!"
var sayHi2 = sayHi; // Assign as varable

sayHi2(); // outputs "Hi!"

sayHi3(sayHi); // pass as perameter

function sayHi3(param){
	console.log("param", param);
}

var cusOBJ = {
	fullNmae: function(){
			return "dileep";
	}
}
console.log(cusOBJ.fullNmae());
