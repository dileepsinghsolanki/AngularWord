*** typeof *****
The typeof operator is used to get the data type of its operand.

function reflect(value) {
 return value;
}
console.log(typeof reflect); //O/P "function"

typeof returns "object". That’s not very helpful
when you’re dealing with a lot of different types. To identify reference
types more easily, you can use JavaScript’s instanceof operator. 

*** instanceof operator ****
The instanceof operator takes an object and a constructor as parameters.
When the value is an instance of the type that the constructor specifies,
instanceof returns true; otherwise, it returns false

var items = [];
console.log(items instanceof Array); // O/P  true

 JavaScript values can be passed back and forth between
frames in the same web page.
when you pass an array from one frame to another,
instanceof doesn’t work because the array is actually an instance of Array
from a different frame.

var items = [];
console.log(Array.isArray(items)); // true
